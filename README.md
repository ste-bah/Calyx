# Calyx

**Calyx is an association-native database.** Instead of storing rows and matching them, or storing one vector and finding its neighbors, Calyx stores *constellations* — one input measured through many frozen lenses — then fuses, grounds, and guards every answer. Built in Rust, with GPU linear algebra baked in.

**[Calyx: An Association-Native Database & Its Path to Planetary-Scale Grounded Intelligence](https://calyxaimemory.com/research/association-native-grounded-intelligence)**
<br/><sub>*A Technical White Paper — Illustrated Formal Edition · Chris Royse, 2026*</sub>

The whole vision, end to end: the **calculus of association**, the grounding **kernel**, the fail-closed **guard**, and Calyx's path from a single workstation to a **neuromorphic, planetary-scale substrate for grounded intelligence** — where every answer is measured, grounded, and traceable to its sources.

> **Calyx** is a database whose native record is the *association-constellation*: one input measured through many frozen embedders ("lenses"), fused, differentiated by the information each one adds, and anchored to real outcomes. It finds the small grounding **kernel** that explains a whole dataset, **guards** generated content against drift and out-of-distribution answers, keeps a tamper-evident **ledger** of how every answer was produced, and gets faster the more you use it.

A *calyx* is the whorl of sepals that holds a flower together at its base — the grounded structure from which a constellation of petals opens. That is exactly what this database is: a grounded base (kernel + provenance) that holds a constellation of vectors and lets it bloom into search, naming, and answers.

---

## 🧩 Calyx is a base, not a finished product

**Calyx is a template.** It computes associations — it measures one input through many lenses, fuses them, finds the grounding kernel, guards every answer, and records provenance. But the moment an association *means* something specific — something you can infer, recognize, or act on — that recognition-and-trigger logic is code *you* write for *your* data. Every Calyx database holds different data, forms different associations, and unlocks different meanings; what happens the instant a meaning is recognized is custom to each project.

That is by design, and it is why Calyx will always be a **base** rather than a shrink-wrapped product. You don't ship the template — you refactor it into your specific use case, exactly like starting a product from a frontend template instead of a blank page. Beginning from the Calyx base, you are already *very* far along: the hard, reusable machinery (constellations, kernel, guard, ledger) is built and grounded for you. What remains is the part only you can write — the meaning your data unlocks, and what your system does when it sees it.

---

## ✨ Why Calyx

Every time you build a serious retrieval or intelligence system, you end up gluing the same machinery together by hand: a vector store for semantics, a keyword index for lexical match, a graph database for relationships, a pile of bespoke code to combine embedders, more code to measure whether a new embedder actually helps, and *still* nothing that tells you when your AI's answer has wandered outside what your data can support.

Calyx bakes that machinery **once, into the storage engine**.

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/vs-oldway.jpg" alt="A tangle of disconnected databases and glue code, versus one unified Calyx constellation" width="90%" />
</div>

| What a multi-signal system needs | Vector DB / pgvector / Elastic / Neo4j | **Calyx bakes in** |
|---|---|---|
| Many embedders, each versioned & frozen | You build the lifecycle yourself | **Registry** — add/retire lenses; each is content-addressed and immutable |
| Combine signals into one ranking | Hand-tuned fusion across systems | **Sextant** — dense + sparse + multi-vector fusion in one query |
| Know which signals actually *help* | You measure mutual information by hand | **Assay** — measures the bits each lens adds; prunes redundant ones |
| Relationships between records | A separate graph database | **Loom** + **Lodestar** — associations are native; the explanatory *kernel* is discoverable |
| Stop the AI from answering off-distribution | Nothing | **Ward** — a calibrated, fail-closed guard on every answer |
| Prove how an answer was produced | Metadata columns, best effort | **Ledger** — hash-chained, tamper-evident provenance |
| Get faster with use | Manual index / quantization tuning | **Anneal** — safe, reversible self-optimization |

> [!NOTE]
> A vector database is a **one-lens Calyx**: a single embedder plus nearest-neighbor search. Calyx is built for the case where one signal is never enough.

---

## 🌟 The core idea: constellations

A traditional database stores a **row**. A vector database stores a **point**. Calyx stores a **constellation**: one input, measured through many independent *lenses* (embedders and feature extractors), each producing its own typed slot-vector — kept **separate**, never flattened into one opaque blob.

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/constellation-model.jpg" alt="One input passes through seven lenses, each producing a cluster of vectors that fuse into one constellation with a gold kernel at its center" width="95%" />
</div>

Calyx is organized around four verbs — the calculus of association:

| Verb | What it means | Subsystem |
|---|---|---|
| **Measure** | Assemble a constellation by viewing one input through every lens in a panel | Registry, Aster |
| **Count** | Derive the associations *between* slots (agreement, delta, interaction) | Loom |
| **Differentiate** | Quantify the unique information each lens contributes about real outcomes | Assay |
| **Compose** | Find the explanatory kernel, guard generation, and answer with provenance | Lodestar, Ward, Ledger |

Three principles make the results trustworthy:

- **Grounding is mandatory.** Every claim is measured against real, anchored outcomes. Ungrounded results are explicitly tagged *provisional* rather than presented as fact.
- **Keep slots separate (no-flatten).** Signals stay typed and independent end-to-end, so you can always see *which* lens drove a result.
- **Fail closed.** Unknown lens, shape mismatch, uncalibrated guard, missing data → a structured error, never a silent wrong answer.

## 🚀 Build from source

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Calyx is a Rust workspace (`edition 2024`, toolchain `1.95`). It builds CPU-only by default; the GPU backend is an opt-in feature.

**Prerequisites**

- Rust `1.95` (via [`rustup`](https://rustup.rs); the pinned toolchain is in `rust-toolchain.toml`)
- A C toolchain (for bundled SQLite, used by the migration tool)
- *Optional, for GPU acceleration:* an NVIDIA `sm_120`-class GPU and CUDA `13.3`

**Build & test**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ChrisRoyse/Calyx.git
cd Calyx

# CPU build (portable, uses SIMD math)
cargo build --release --workspace

# Run the test suite
cargo test --workspace

# Optional: build with the CUDA backend
cargo build --release --workspace --features cuda
```

> [!NOTE]
> The polished public CLI and the agent-facing MCP server are in active development. A dedicated usage guide will ship alongside them — see [Project status](#-project-status).

## 🧭 Architecture

Calyx is **not** a service mesh. It is an embedded engine — a stack of focused Rust crates — with three thin entry points on top: a CLI (`calyx`), a daemon (`calyxd`), and an MCP server (`calyx-mcp`).

Every subsystem is named for an instrument of celestial navigation: a lens is a sighting instrument, the kernel is the guiding star, and search is navigation.

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/architecture.jpg" alt="Calyx architecture: four layered tiers — Entry points (calyx CLI, calyxd daemon, calyx-mcp agent) above the Intelligence layer (Oracle, Anneal, Lodestar), above the Association engine (Sextant, Loom, Assay, Ward, Registry), above Storage & math (Aster, Forge, Ledger, Core)" width="92%" />
</div>

| Subsystem | Crate | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| 🪐 **Aster** | `calyx-aster` | Embedded LSM storage: write-ahead log, group-commit, MVCC snapshots, memory-mapped tables, crash recovery, hot/cold tiering. The "schema" layer. |
| 🔥 **Forge** | `calyx-forge` | The numeric runtime: one math backend implemented twice — CPU SIMD and CUDA — engineered for bit-near parity. Quantization from full precision down to 1-bit. |
| 🔭 **Registry** | `calyx-registry` | The lens registry: seven embedder runtimes (local, server, ONNX, algorithmic, multimodal…), each frozen and content-addressed. Hot-swap and lazy backfill. |
| 🧭 **Sextant** | `calyx-sextant` | Search & navigation: in-RAM and on-disk vector indexes, keyword (BM25) index, late-interaction, and multi-signal fusion with a query planner. |
| 🕸️ **Loom** | `calyx-loom` | Derives the associations *between* slots (agreement, delta, interaction) and weaves them into a queryable association graph. |
| ⚖️ **Assay** | `calyx-assay` | Measures the information (in bits) each lens contributes about real outcomes, enforces a redundancy contract, and reports panel sufficiency. |
| ⭐ **Lodestar** | `calyx-lodestar` | Discovers the small **grounding kernel** that explains a corpus, and turns it into both an index and an answer path. |
| 🛡️ **Ward** | `calyx-ward` | The fail-closed guard: scores every required slot independently against a calibrated threshold and refuses out-of-distribution or ungrounded content. |
| 📜 **Ledger** | `calyx-ledger` | Append-only, hash-chained provenance with periodic signed checkpoints and tamper-evident verification. |
| ♨️ **Anneal** | `calyx-anneal` | Reversible self-optimization: tunes the engine within safety tripwires and rolls back anything that regresses quality. |
| 🔮 **Oracle** | `calyx-oracle` | Consequence prediction over grounded constellations, with an honesty gate that refuses to answer when the data can't support it. |
| 🧩 **Core** | `calyx-core` | The dependency-free foundation: identifiers, the closed error catalog, the data model, and the engine traits everything else implements. |

## 🧠 The intelligence layer

What makes Calyx more than a fast multi-index search engine is the layer that turns retrieval into *grounded* intelligence.

### ⭐ Lodestar — the grounding kernel

Most datasets are mostly redundant. Lodestar discovers the small set of records — the **kernel** — that actually carries the structure of the whole corpus, scoring candidates by how central and how *grounded* they are. The kernel then doubles as a fast index and as an answer path: route a query through the kernel first, then walk its edges to an answer.

### 🛡️ Ward — the no-hallucination guard

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/ward-guard.jpg" alt="A glowing trusted region with a gold kernel inside, deflecting an out-of-distribution intruder at its boundary" width="88%" />
</div>

Ward is a **fail-closed boundary** around what your data can support. Each required slot is scored *independently* against a calibrated threshold — there is no single averaged gate that a strong score on one slot can sneak past. Anything outside the trusted region is refused, quarantined, or recorded as a new region to learn — never waved through. Thresholds are set by conformal calibration to a target false-accept rate, so the guard's strictness is a number you choose, not a guess.

### 📜 Ledger — provenance you can verify

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/ledger.jpg" alt="A hash-chained sequence of crystalline blocks anchored by glowing gold checkpoints" width="90%" />
</div>

Every measurement, kernel, guard verdict, and answer is appended to a hash-chained ledger. Each entry seals the one before it, so any tampering is detectable; periodic checkpoints can be cryptographically signed; and a single command can re-verify the entire chain. You can always answer the question *"how was this produced, and has anything changed since?"*

### ♨️ Anneal — a database that improves with use

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/anneal.jpg" alt="A constellation tightening and brightening as redundant points are pruned away, over a rising growth curve" width="90%" />
</div>

Anneal continuously tunes the engine — index parameters, quantization levels, fusion weights — but **safely**: every change is gated against quality tripwires and shadow-tested before it goes live, and anything that regresses recall, latency, or guard accuracy is automatically reverted. Optimization that can only make things better, and is always reversible.

### 🔮 Oracle — grounded consequence prediction

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/oracle.jpg" alt="A branching consequence tree fanning out from a single action, with grounded branches glowing brighter" width="90%" />
</div>

Oracle predicts the grounded consequences of an action by mining recurrence patterns in your data, builds a branching "butterfly" tree of likely downstream effects, and can even walk backward from an outcome to its likely causes. Crucially, it has an **honesty gate**: when the available signals can't support a confident prediction, Oracle returns *insufficient* with the specific deficits — instead of fabricating an answer.

---

## 🗄️ One core, every paradigm

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/universal-db.jpg" alt="Relational, document, key-value, columnar, graph, time-series, full-text, and vector paradigms all converging into one glowing core" width="92%" />
</div>

Because everything is built on one ordered, transactional storage core, Calyx can serve the role of many database shapes at once:

| Paradigm | How Calyx serves it |
|---|---|
| **Vector** | A dense lens + per-slot ANN search — a vector DB is a one-lens Calyx |
| **Full-text** | A sparse lexical lens with a BM25 inverted index |
| **Graph** | Associations are native; cross-terms are edges and the kernel is a path |
| **Time-series** | Range keys + temporal lenses, with time scoring that is *additive and never dominant* |
| **Key-value / Document / Relational** | Typed records and keyed state on the same transactional core |

The search-shaped paradigms collapse into the association engine; the storage-shaped ones are the general data layer beneath it. One engine, one transaction, one source of truth.

## 🗺️ Project status

> [!WARNING]
> **Calyx is pre-1.0 software under active development.** The on-disk format and public interfaces may change before a stable release.

The core engine — storage, math, the lens registry, multi-signal search, the association and information layers, the grounding kernel, the guard, the ledger, self-optimization, and the first oracle capabilities — is built and working.

Actively expanding toward 1.0:

- **A richer public CLI and a populated MCP toolset** so agents can drive the full engine directly.
- **Scale-out vector indexing** (on-disk graph and centroid-partitioned indexes) for very large vaults.
- **Server & deployment polish** for running `calyxd` as a managed service.
- **Broader validation** of the oracle and guard against public benchmark corpora.

> [!NOTE]
> **The dream.** Calyx's north star is a *grounded substrate for planetary-scale intelligence*: hold the world's data un-flattened, measure it through many diverse lenses, derive the associations between distant domains, and surface **ranked, provenance-backed, validatable hypotheses** — never ungrounded answers. Two levers maximize what it can discover: **corpus breadth** and **lens diversity**. In a world where any answer is cheap to generate, the scarce resource is *grounded verification* — knowing what is true and being able to trace it to its sources — and that is exactly what Calyx is built to provide. The [white paper](https://calyxaimemory.com/research/association-native-grounded-intelligence) lays out the full path, including why this workload's natural long-term home is **neuromorphic, in-memory hardware**. That vision is aspirational and Calyx is pre-1.0; the honesty gate that underpins it is already built.
